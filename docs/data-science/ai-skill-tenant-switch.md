# AI skill tenant settings

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

Fabric has a new tenant setting. Users can create and share AI Skill item types.

You can create natural language data questions and answer (or "Q & A") experiences using generative AI. You can then save those experiences as AI skill items. You can share AI skill items with others in your organization.

By default, the **Tenant settings** for a Fabric AI skill are disabled. Ask your tenant admins to enable them if you're allowed to use the AI skill.
