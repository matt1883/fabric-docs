To open the accompanying notebook for this tutorial, follow the instructions in [Prepare your system for data science tutorials](../tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#import-tutorial-notebooks), to import the notebook to your workspace.  

If you'd rather copy and paste the code from this page, you can [create a new notebook](../../data-engineering/how-to-use-notebook.md#create-notebooks).

Be sure to [attach a lakehouse to the notebook](../tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#attach-a-lakehouse-to-the-notebooks) before you start running code.
