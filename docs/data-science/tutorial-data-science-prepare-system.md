# Prepare your system for data science tutorials

Before you begin the data science end-to-end tutorial series, learn about prerequisites, how to import notebooks, and how to attach a lakehouse to those notebooks.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites](./includes/prerequisites.md)]

* If you don't have a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse, create one by following the steps in [Create a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric](../data-engineering/create-lakehouse.md).

## Import tutorial notebooks

We utilize the notebook item in the Data Science experience to demonstrate various Fabric capabilities. The notebooks are available as Jupyter notebook files that can be imported to your Fabric-enabled workspace.

1. Download your notebook(s).  Make sure to download the files by using the "Raw" file link in GitHub.
    * For the **Get started** notebooks, download the notebook(.ipynb) files from the parent folder: [data-science-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/tree/main/docs-samples/data-science/data-science-tutorial).
    * For the **Tutorials** notebooks, download the notebooks(.ipynb) files from the parent folder [ai-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/tree/main/docs-samples/data-science/ai-samples).

1. On the Data science experience homepage, select **Import notebook** and upload the notebook files that you downloaded in step 1.

1. Once the notebooks are imported, select **Go to workspace** in the import dialog box.

1. The imported notebooks are now available in your workspace for use.

1. If the imported notebook includes output, select the **Edit** menu, then select **Clear all outputs**.

## Attach a lakehouse to the notebooks

To demonstrate Fabric lakehouse features, many of the tutorials require attaching a default lakehouse to the notebooks. The following steps show how to add a lakehouse to a notebook in a Fabric-enabled workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> Before executing each notebooks, you need to perform these steps on that notebook. 

1. Open the notebook in the workspace.

1. Select **Add lakehouse** in the left pane.

1. Create a new lakehouse or use an existing lakehouse.
    1. To create a new lakehouse, select **New**. Give the lakehouse a name and select **Create**.
    1. To use an existing lakehouse, select **Existing lakehouse** to open the **Data hub** dialog box. Select the lakehouse you want to use and then select **Add**.

1. Once a lakehouse is added, it's visible in the lakehouse pane and you can view tables and files stored in the lakehouse.
