# Understand your Azure bill on a Fabric capacity

When you use a Fabric capacity, your usage charges appear in the Azure portal under your subscription in the [Microsoft Cost Management](/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) experience.

## Invoice meters

In Microsoft Cost Management, your cost analysis and invoice show multiple meters related to your Fabric capacity resource. The following table includes a complete list of all of the meters.

The total usage from all meters adds up to the cost of the provisioned Fabric capacity.

## Comparing your Azure bill with your usage

Use the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics](metrics-app-compute-page.md) to correlate your Azure bill with usage analytics generated from your organizationâ€™s usage of Fabric.

The default view in the app shows trends in consumption by workload over the past 14 days.

Usage in the items table is aggregated by workspace, workload type, and item name. The amount of billable usage generated by each item is aggregated by CUs.

To compare the information in the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app to what you're seeing in Azure, filter your cost management view in the Azure portal so that it displays the same time period as the app. Review the cost under the meter for the item you're reviewing (for example, for Warehouse, it's the _Data Warehouse Capacity Usage CU_ meter). The price per CU hour for your capacity depends on your capacity's region. You can view the Fabric prices per region in the [Microsoft Fabric pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/) page.
