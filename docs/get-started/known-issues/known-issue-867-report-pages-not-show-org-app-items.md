# Known issue - Report pages not showing in org app items

Org apps have a report pages navigation setting. If the setting is enabled and you have a report with pages, you might run into any issues. The navigation doesn't appear to work and you don't see the report pages pane in the consumer experience for org apps.

**Status:** Fixed: October 15, 2024

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

When working in Fabric org apps, you don't see the **Pages** pane. Additionally, you can't navigate from page to page for a report in an org app. The report navigation in the org app appears to be broken. However, you can clearly see the report pages when you directly view a report.

## Solutions and workarounds

No workarounds at this time. Until the issue is fixed, don't use Fabric org app items in preview. You can continue to use Power BI apps.
