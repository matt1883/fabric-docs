# Publish a workload to Fabric (preview)

Once your workload is [uploaded](manage-workload.md) to Fabric, you can publish it.

## How to publish my workload

Follow these steps to publish your workload:

1. Log into Fabric and go to *Settings* (&#9881;) > **Admin portal**.

2. Select **Workloads**.

3. In the *Public Sample Workload* pane, select the **Publish** tab.

4. From the **Select Version** dropdown list, select the version of the workload you want to publish.

5. In the **Publish to** field, select the tenants you want to publish the workload to.

6. Select **Publish**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to publish to your own tenant, ensure you first deactivate the workload from the admin portal.  
> Refer to the [deactivation instructions](manage-workload.md) for detailed steps.
