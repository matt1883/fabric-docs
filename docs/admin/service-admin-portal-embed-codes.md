# Manage embed codes

As a Fabric administrator, you can view the embed codes that are generated for sharing reports publicly, using the [Publish to web from Power BI](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web) feature. You can also disable or delete embed codes.

To learn how to access the Fabric admin portal settings, see [What is the admin portal?](admin-center.md)

## Disable embed codes

You can disable the *Publish to web* feature, or allow embed codes to work only in your organization. If you disable *Publish to web*, the existing embed codes aren't deleted. When you reenable *Publish to web*, the existing embed codes become active again.

Disabling the embed codes is described in [Publish to web](service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#publish-to-web).

## Delete embed codes

To delete embed codes, select the codes you want to delete and then select **Delete**.
