# Connect to Azure resources securely using managed private endpoints (Preview)

Managed Private Endpoint is a network security feature of the Fabric platform that allows Fabric items to securely access data sources behind a firewall or not accessible from the public internet. By integrating Eventstream with the Managed Private Endpoint, a managed VNet is automatically created for Eventstream, allowing you to securely connect to your Azure resources within a private network. This ensures that your data is securely transmitted over a private network.

The following diagram shows a sample architecture for connecting Eventstream to Azure event hub within a virtual network:

## Supported regions and data sources

* **Supported regions for Eventstream managed VNet**: Only selected Fabric tenant regions are supported for Eventstream managed VNet. These regions include:
  * Australia Southeast
  * East US
  * Canada Central
  * East US 2
  * North Central US
  * North Europe
  * West Europe
  * West US
* **Supported data sources**: In alignment with the Managed Private Endpoints in Fabric, Eventstream only supports private connections for the following Azure resources:
  * **Azure Event Hubs**
  * **Azure IoT Hub**

## Connect to Azure Event Hubs using a managed private endpoint

Setting up a private connection in Eventstream is straightforward. Follow these steps to create a managed private endpoint for an Azure event hub and stream data to Eventstream over private network.  

### Prerequisites

* Managed private endpoints are supported for **Fabric trial** and **all Fabric F SKU** capacities.
* Only users with **Workspace Admin** permissions can create Managed Private Endpoints
* An Azure event hub with public access disabled, and its **Resource ID** ready for creating a private endpoint.
* A Fabric tenant region that supports managed VNet for Eventstream.

### Step 1: Create an eventstream

* Switch your Power BI experience to **Real-time Intelligence**.
* Navigate to the **Eventstream** section and select **Create**. Name your Eventstream such as â€œeventstream-1."

### Step 2: Create a private endpoint

* In the Fabric workspace, go to the **Workspace settings** and navigate to the **Network security** section.
* Select **Create** to add a new private endpoint.
* Enter the resource ID of your Azure Event Hubs.

### Step 3: Approve the private endpoint in Azure Event Hubs

* Go to the Azure portal and open your Azure event hub.
* In the **Networking** section, navigate to the **Private endpoint connections** tab.
* Locate the private endpoint request from your Fabric workspace and approve it.
* Once approved, the managed private endpoint status updates to **Approved**.

### Step 4: Add an Azure Event Hubs source to Eventstream

* Go back to the eventstream you created in Fabric.
* Select **Azure Event Hubs** and add it as a source to your Eventstream.
* When creating a new connection to your Azure event hub, uncheck the **Test connection** option if your event hub is not publicly accessible.
* Manually enter the **Consumer group**.

Once added, Eventstream starts pulling data from your Azure event hub over the private network.

By following these steps, you have a fully operational Eventstream running over a secure private network, using the managed private endpoint to ensure secure data streaming.

## Limitations

* The Data Preview feature may be unavailable in certain sections when connected through a managed private endpoint; however, data will still flow correctly to the destination.
