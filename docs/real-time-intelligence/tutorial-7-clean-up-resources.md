# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 7: Clean up resources

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 6: Set an alert on your event stream](tutorial-6-set-alert.md).

## Clean up resources

Once you finish the tutorial, you might want to delete all resources you created. You can delete the event stream, eventhouse, KQL queryset, Real-Time dashboard, and Power BI report items individually, or you can delete the entire workspace.

1. Browse to the workspace in which you created the tutorial.
1. From the menu ribbon, select **Workspace settings**.
1. In the **General** settings pane, scroll down to the **Delete workspace** section.
1. Select **Remove this workspace**.
1. On the warning dialog that open, select **Delete**. Once a workspace is deleted, it can't be recovered.
