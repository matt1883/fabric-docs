# Create a KQL database

In Real-Time Intelligence, you interact with your data in the context of [eventhouses](eventhouse.md), databases, and tables. A single workspace can hold multiple Eventhouses, an eventhouse can hold multiple databases, and each database can hold multiple tables.

In this article, you learn how to create a new KQL database. Once your KQL database has data, you can proceed to query your data using Kusto Query Language in a KQL queryset.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Create a new KQL database

1. To create a new KQL database, in the Eventhouse explorer either:

    * Select **Eventhouse** then **New database +**
    * Under **KQL Databases** select **+**  

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-database/create-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the eventhouse KQL Databases section.":::

1. Enter your database name, select your database type, either **New database (default)** or **New shortcut database (follower)**, then select **Create**. For information about follower databases, see [Create a database shortcut](database-shortcut.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The database name can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Special characters aren't supported.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-database/new-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New KQL Database window showing the database name. The Create button is highlighted.":::

The KQL database is created within the context of the selected eventhouse.

### Explore your KQL database

When you create a new KQL database, an attached environment is automatically created to explore and manage the KQL database using KQL queries. For more information, see [KQL overview](/kusto/query/).

1. To access the query environment, select *KQLdatabasename_queryset* from your KQL database object tree.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-database/attached-queryset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new attached KQL queryset to a KQL database.":::

1. To rename the query environment, select the **Pencil icon** next to its name, and enter a new name.

## Database details

The main page of your KQL database shows an overview of the contents of your database. The following tables list the available information in the center and right information panes.

### Database right pane details

The right information pane displays the details of the selected database.
<!--| Size? | Compression ratio | Compression ratio of the data.|
-->
|Card | Item| Description|
|---|---|---|
| **Size**|
| | Compressed| Total size of compressed data.|
| | Original size | Total size of uncompressed data.|
| **OneLake**|
| | Availability| Set OneLake availability to **On** or **Off**. When OneLake availability is turned on, tables can't be renamed.|
| | Latency| The maximum time until data is available across tables in OneLake.|
| |Table number |The number of tables available in OneLake. |
| | OneLake folder | OneLake folder path that can be used for creating shortcuts.|
|**Overview**|
| | Created by | The user name of person who created the database, if available, and the database creation date.|
| | Region | Shows the region where your capacity is hosted. For more information, see [Fabric region availability](../admin/region-availability.md).|
| | Query URI | The URI used to run queries or management commands.|
| | Ingestion URI | The date of the last data ingestion and the URI that can be used to get data.|
| | Caching Policy | The time period in which data is cached and kept in local SSD storage. For more information, see [Caching policy](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-policies#caching-policy).|
| | Retention Policy | The time period after which data is automatically removed from tables or materialized views. For more information, see [Data retention policy](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-policies#data-retention-policy).|

### Database center information pane

The center database information pane depicts a histogram of the ingestion data, table information, and a means to preview the database ingestion information.  

|Card | Item| Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Histogram**|
| | Number of rows | The number of rows loaded into the database in the selected time range.|
| | Last run | The time when the histogram was last generated.|
| | Interval | Set the interval of the histogram display. Set intervals by one hour, six hours, one day, three days, seven days, and 30 days. |
| | Refresh | Refresh your histogram.|
| | Histogram | The ingestion histogram displays data by the interval chosen. The interval is calculated by a full coordinated universal time (UTC) day, but displays according to the local time.|
|**Tables**|
| | Search for table| Search for a database table.|
| | New table | Create a new table|
| | Tables display | View table information by **Cards** or by **List** view. </br></br>Cards and list view both display table name, *Compressed size*, *Last ingestion*, and *OneLake* availability or latency. </br></br>Cards uniquely display a histogram of the database ingestion over the past seven days, the number of rows ingested in the last ingestion, and the table creator profile. </br></br>The list view display also shows total *Row count*, *Caching*, and *Retention*. |
|**Data preview**|
| | Data preview | Shows a preview of the last 100 records ingested for each table. Displays Ingestion time, TableName, and Record. Select **Columns** to select columns and values for a Pivot view.|

## Table details

Select a table in your KQL database to see an overview of the table. The following tables list the available information in the center and right information panes.

### Table right pane details

The right information pane displays the details of the selected table.

|Card | Item| Description|
|---|---|---|

| | Availability | Set OneLake availability to **On** or **Off**. When OneLake availability is turned on, tables can't be renamed. |
| | Latency| The maximum time until table data is available in OneLake.|
| | Since | The start time from when availability is recorded. |
| | OneLake folder | OneLake folder path that can be used for creating shortcuts.|
|**Overview**|
| | Row count | The number of rows in the table.|
| | Rows ingested last 24 h | The number of rows ingested in the last 24 hours.|
| | Schema last altered by | When the schema was last altered and by whom.|
| | Ingestion URI | The date of the last data ingestion and the URI that can be used to get data.|
