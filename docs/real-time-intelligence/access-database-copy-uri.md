# Access an existing KQL database

In this article, you learn how to access an existing KQL database and optionally copy the **Query URI** and the **Ingestion URI** to run queries, store management commands, or to get data.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Access a KQL database

To access your existing KQL databases:

1. On the left side navigation, select the **Workspaces** icon. Then choose a workspace.

1. Select the desired database from the list of items shown in the main view pane. The main page of the KQL database opens.

## Copy URI

The main page of your KQL database shows an overview of the contents in your database.

:::image type="content" source="media/set-up-connectors/copy-uri.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the database details card showing the database details. The options titled Query URI and Ingestion URI are highlighted.":::

There are two types of URIs that you can copy from the **Database details** card in your KQL database.

|URI type |Usage |
|---|---|
|Query URI |URI that can be used to run queries or management commands.|
|Ingestion URI |URI that can be used as a target for data ingestion.|
