# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 4: Create a Real-Time Dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 3: Query streaming data in a KQL queryset](tutorial-3-query-data.md).

In this part of the tutorial, you learn how to create a Real-Time Dashboard in Real-Time Intelligence. You create a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query, create a Real-Time Dashboard, add a new tile to the dashboard, and explore the data visually by adding an aggregation.

## Create a Real-Time Dashboard

1. In your KQL queryset, copy/paste, and run the following query. This query returns a column chart showing the most recent number of bikes by *BikepointID*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your KQL queryset comes prepopulated with several queries. Make sure there's an empty line between any existing query and the new query you're adding, so that you can run this query separately.

    ```kusto
    TutorialTable
    | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, No_Bikes) by BikepointID
    | sort by BikepointID
    | render columnchart with (ycolumns=No_Bikes, xcolumn= BikepointID)
    ```

1. Select **Pin to dashboard**.
1. Enter the following information:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial/pin-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pinning query to dashboard in Real-Time Intelligence.":::

    | Field | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Create new tile** | *In a new dashboard* |
    | **Dashboard name** | *TutorialDashboard* |
    | **Tile name** | *Recent bikes by Timepoint* |
    | **Open dashboard after creation** | *Selected* |

1. Select **Create**.

Since you've selected **Open dashboard after creation**, the new Real-Time dashboard, *TutorialDashboard*, opens with the *Recent bikes by Bikepoint* tile. You can also access the Real-Time dashboard by browsing to your workspace and selecting the desired item.

## Add a new tile to the dashboard

1. On the top menu bar, toggle from **Viewing** mode to **Editing** mode.
1. Select **New tile**

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial/new-tile.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Real-Time Dashboard in editing mode with new tile selected.":::

1. In the query editor, enter the following query:

    ```kusto
    TutorialTable
    | where Neighbourhood == "Chelsea"
    ```

1. From the menu ribbon, Select **Apply changes**.
    A new tile is created.
1. Rename the tile by selecting the **More menu [...]** on the top right corner of the tile > **Rename tile**.
1. Enter the new name *Chelsea bikes* to rename the tile.

## Explore the data visually by adding an aggregation

1. On the new **Chelsea bikes** tile, select the **Explore** icon. :::image type="icon" source="media/tutorial/explore-icon.png" border="false":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial/add-aggregation.gif" alt-text="GIF of how to visually add and modify the query." border="false":::

1. Select **+ Add** > **Aggregation**.
1. Select **+ Add grouping**.
1. Select **Group by** > *Street*.
1. Select **Apply**.

    Notice that the query elements are updated to include the green **count() by Street** aggregation. The resulting table changed to show the total count of bike locations by street.
1. Close the **Explore** pane and select **Save** from the menu ribbon to save the changes.
