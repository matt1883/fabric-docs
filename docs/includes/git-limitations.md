### General Git integration limitations

- The [authentication method](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage#authentication-methods-policy) in Fabric must be at least as strong as the authentication method for Git. For example, if Git requires multifactor authentication, Fabric needs to require multifactor authentication as well.
- Power BI Datasets connected to Analysis Services aren't supported at this time.
- Workspaces with template apps installed can't be connected to Git.
- Sovereign clouds aren't supported.

#### [Azure DevOps limitations](#tab/azure-devops)

- The Azure DevOps account must be registered to the same user that is using the Fabric workspace.
- The tenant admin must enable [cross-geo exports](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#users-can-export-items-to-git-repositories-in-other-geographical-locations-preview) if the workspace and Git repo are in two different geographical regions.
- The commit size is limited to 125 MB.

#### [GitHub limitations](#tab/github)

- GitHub can't enforce [cross-geo validations](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#users-can-export-items-to-git-repositories-in-other-geographical-locations-preview).
- The total combined size of files to commit at once is limited to 50 MB. Therefore, if you have several items to commit, it might sometimes be necessary to separate them into a few separate commits. For more information about committing files, see our [troubleshooting guide](/fabric/cicd/troubleshoot-cicd#maximum-commit-size-exceeded).

### GitHub Enterprise limitations

Some GitHub Enterprise settings aren't supported. For example:

- IP allowlist
- Private networking
- [Custom domains](https://docs.github.com/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

### Workspace limitations

- Only the workspace admin can manage the connections to the [Git Repo](/azure/devops/repos/get-started) such as connecting, disconnecting, or adding a branch.  
Once connected, anyone with [permission](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process#permissions) can work in the workspace.  
- The workspace folder structure isn't reflected in the Git repository. Workspace items in folders are exported to the root directory.

### Branch and folder limitations

- Maximum length of branch name is 244 characters.
- Maximum length of full path for file names is 250 characters. Longer names fail.
- Maximum file size is 25 MB.
- You can’t download a report/dataset as *.pbix* from the service after deploying them with Git integration.
- When naming a folder in Git, the logical ID (Guid) is added as a prefix before the type if the item’s display name:
  - Has more than 256 characters
  - Ends with <kbd>.</kbd> or a space
  - Contains any of the following characters: <kbd>"</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> <kbd>:</kbd> <kbd><</kbd> <kbd>></kbd> <kbd>\\</kbd> <kbd>*</kbd> <kbd>?</kbd> <kbd>|</kbd>

### Branching out limitations

- Branch out requires permissions listed in [permissions table](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process#fabric-permissions-needed-for-common-operations).
- There must be an available capacity for this action.
- All [workspace](#workspace-limitations) and [branch naming limitations](#branch-and-folder-limitations) apply when branching out to a new workspace.
- When branching out, a new workspace is created and the settings from the original workspace aren't copied. Adjust any settings or definitions to ensure that the new workspace meets your organization's policies.
- Only [Git supported items](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration#supported-items) are available in the new workspace.
- The related branches list only shows branches and workspaces you have permission to view.
- [Git integration](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings) must be enabled.

### Sync and commit limitations

- You can only sync in one direction at a time. You can’t commit and update at the same time.
- Sensitivity labels aren't supported and exporting items with sensitivity labels might be disabled. To commit items that have sensitivity labels without the sensitivity label, [ask your administrator](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#users-can-export-workspace-items-with-applied-sensitivity-labels-to-git-repositories-preview) for help.
- Works with [limited items](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration#supported-items). Unsupported items in the folder are ignored.
- Duplicating names isn't allowed. Even if Power BI allows name duplication, the update, commit, or undo action fails.
- B2B isn’t supported.
- [Conflict resolution](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/conflict-resolution) is partially done in Git.
- During the *Commit to Git* process, the Fabric service deletes files *inside the item folder* that aren't part of the item definition. Unrelated files not in an item folder aren't deleted.
- After you commit changes, you might notice some unexpected changes to the item that you didn't make. These changes are semantically insignificant and can happen for several reasons. For example:
  - Manually changing the item definition file. These changes are valid, but might be different than if done through the editors. For example, if you rename a semantic model column in Git and import this change to the workspace, the next time you commit changes to the semantic model, the *bim* file will register as changed and the modified column pushed to the back of the `columns` array. This is because the AS engine that generates the *bim* files pushes renamed columns to the end of the array. This change doesn't affect the way the item operates.
  - Committing a file that uses *CRLF* line breaks. The service uses *LF* (line feed) line breaks. If you had item files in the Git repo with *CRLF* line breaks, when you commit from the service these files are changed to *LF*. For example, if you open a report in desktop, save the *.pbip* project and upload it to Git using *CRLF*.
- Refreshing a semantic model using the [Enhanced refresh API](/power-bi/connect-data/asynchronous-refresh) causes a Git diff after each refresh.
