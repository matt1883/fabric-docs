      |**Authentication kind**| Fabric uses Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) keys to access Google Cloud storage. These keys are associated with a user or service account. The account must have permission to access the data within the GCS bucket. If the bucket specific endpoint was used in the connection URL, the account must have the `storage.objects.get` and `stoage.objects.list` permissions. If the global endpoint was used in the connection URL, the account must also have the `storage.buckets.list` permission. | HMAC Key|
      |**Access ID**| The access key associated with a user or service account. For more on creating HMAC keys, see [Manage HMAC Keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys#create). | Your access key.|
      |**Secret**| The secret for the access key. | Your secret key.|
