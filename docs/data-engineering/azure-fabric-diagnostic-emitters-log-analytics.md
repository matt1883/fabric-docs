# Monitor Apache Spark applications with Azure log analytics (preview)

The Fabric Apache Spark diagnostic emitter extension is a library that enables Apache Spark applications to emit logs, event logs, and metrics to multiple destinations, including Azure log analytics, Azure storage, and Azure event hubs.

In this tutorial, you learn how to configure and emit Spark logs and metrics to Log analytics in Fabric. Once configured, you are able to collect and analyze Apache Spark application metrics and logs in your [Log analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace). 

## Configure workspace information

Follow these steps to configure the necessary information in Fabric.

### Step 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

Consult one of the following resources to create this workspace:
- [Create a workspace in the Azure portal.](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace)
- [Create a workspace with Azure CLI.](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/resource-manager-workspace)
- [Create and configure a workspace in Azure Monitor by using PowerShell.](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace#create-a-workspace)


### Step 2: Create a Fabric environment artifact with Apache Spark configuration
To configure Spark, create a Fabric Environment Artifact and choose one of the following options:

#### Option 1: Configure with Log Analytics Workspace ID and Key

1. Create a Fabric Environment Artifact in Fabric
2. Add the following **Spark properties** with the appropriate values to the environment artifact, or select **Add from .yml** in the ribbon to download the [sample yaml file](https://sparklighter.blob.core.windows.net/package/FabricSparkMonitorConfiguration/log_analytics_spark_properties_option_1.yml), which already containing the required properties.  

   - `<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>`: Log Analytics workspace ID.
   - `<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_KEY>`: Log Analytics key. To find this, in the Azure portal, go to **Azure Log Analytics workspace** > **Agents** > **Primary key**.

   ```properties
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitters: LA
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.type: "AzureLogAnalytics"
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.categories: "Log,EventLog,Metrics"
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.workspaceId: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.secret: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_KEY>
   spark.fabric.pools.skipStarterPools: "true" //Add this Spark property when using the default pool.
   ```

   Alternatively, to apply the same configuration as Azure Synapse, use the following properties, or select **Add from .yml** in the ribbon to download the [sample yaml file](https://sparklighter.blob.core.windows.net/package/FabricSparkMonitorConfiguration/log_analytics_spark_properties_option_1_synapse.yml).

   ```properties
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.enabled: "true"
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.workspaceId: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.secret: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_KEY>
   spark.fabric.pools.skipStarterPools: "true" //Add this Spark property when using the default pool.
   ```

3. Save and publish changes.

#### Option 2: Configure with Azure Key Vault

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Known issue**: Unable to start a session using Option 2 provisionally.
> Currently, storing secrets in Key Vault prevents Spark sessions from starting. Please prioritize configuring it using the method outlined in Option 1.
> 
> You need to grant read secret permission to the users who will submit Apache Spark applications. For more information, see [Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide).

To configure Azure Key Vault to store the workspace key, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Key Vault in the Azure portal.
2. On the settings page for the key vault, select **Secrets**, then **Generate/Import**.
3. On the **Create a secret** screen, Enter the following values:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the secret. For the default, enter `SparkLogAnalyticsSecret`.
   - **Value**: Enter the `<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_KEY>` for the secret.
   - Leave the other values to their defaults. Then select **Create**.
4. Create a Fabric Environment Artifact in Fabric
5. Add the following **Spark properties** with the corresponding values to the environment artifact, or Select **Add from .yml** on the ribbon in the Environment artifact to download the [sample yaml file](https://sparklighter.blob.core.windows.net/package/FabricSparkMonitorConfiguration/log_analytics_spark_properties_option_2.yml) which includes following Spark properties.

   - `<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>`: The Log Analytics workspace ID.
   - `<AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME>`: The key vault name that you configured.
   - `<AZURE_KEY_VAULT_SECRET_KEY_NAME>` (optional): The secret name in the key vault for the workspace key. The default is `SparkLogAnalyticsSecret`.

   ```properties
   // Spark properties for LA
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitters LA
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.type: "AzureLogAnalytics"
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.categories: "Log,EventLog,Metrics"
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.workspaceId: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.secret.keyVault: <AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME>
   spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.LA.secret.keyVault.secretName: <AZURE_KEY_VAULT_SECRET_KEY_NAME>
   spark.fabric.pools.skipStarterPools: "true" //Add this Spark property when using the default pool.
   ```

   Alternatively, to apply the same configuration as Azure Synapse, use the following properties, or select Add from .yml in the ribbon to download the [sample yaml file](https://sparklighter.blob.core.windows.net/package/FabricSparkMonitorConfiguration/log_analytics_spark_properties_option_2_synapse.yml).

   ```properties
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.enabled: "true"
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.workspaceId: <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.keyVault.name: <AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME>
   spark.synapse.logAnalytics.keyVault.key.secret: <AZURE_KEY_VAULT_SECRET_KEY_NAME>
   spark.fabric.pools.skipStarterPools: "true" //Add this Spark property when using the default pool.
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > You can also store the workspace ID in Key Vault. Set the secret name to `SparkLogAnalyticsWorkspaceId`, or use the configuration `spark.synapse.logAnalytics.keyVault.key.workspaceId` to specify the workspace ID secret name.

   For a list of Apache Spark configurations, see [Available Apache Spark configurations](/azure/synapse-analytics/monitor-synapse-analytics-reference#available-apache-spark-configurations)

 6. Save and publish changes.

### Step 3: Attach the environment artifact to notebooks or spark job definitions, or set it as the workspace default

**To attach the environment to notebooks or Spark job definitions:**
1. Navigate to your notebook or Spark job definition in Fabric.
2. Select the **Environment** menu on the Home tab and select the configured environment.
3. The configuration will be applied after starting a **Spark session**.

**To set the environment as the workspace default:**

1. Navigate to Workspace settings in Fabric.
2. Find the **Spark settings** in your Workspace settings **(Workspace setting -> Data Engineering/Science -> Spark settings)**
3. Select **Environment** tab and choose the environment with diagnostics spark properties configured, and click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Only workspace admins can manage configurations. The values will apply to notebooks and Spark job definitions that attach to Workspace Settings. For more details, see [Fabric Workspace Settings](../get-started/workspaces.md).


## Submit an Apache Spark application and view the logs and metrics

To submit an Apache Spark application:

1. Submit an Apache Spark application, with the associated environment, which was configured in the previous step. You can use any of the following ways to do so:
    - Run a notebook in Fabric. 
    - Submit an Apache Spark batch job through an Apache Spark job definition.
    - Run your Spark activities in your Pipelines.

2. Go to the specified Log Analytics workspace, and then view the application metrics and logs when the Apache Spark application starts to run.

## Write custom application logs

You can use the Apache Log4j library to write custom logs. Here are examples for Scala and PySpark:

Scala Example:
```scala
%%spark
val logger = org.apache.log4j.LogManager.getLogger("com.contoso.LoggerExample")
logger.info("info message")
logger.warn("warn message")
logger.error("error message")
//log exception
try {
      1/0
 } catch {
      case e:Exception =>logger.warn("Exception", e)
}
// run job for task level metrics
val data = sc.parallelize(Seq(1,2,3,4)).toDF().count()
```

PySpark Example:

```python
%%pyspark
logger = sc._jvm.org.apache.log4j.LogManager.getLogger("com.contoso.PythonLoggerExample")
logger.info("info message")
logger.warn("warn message")
logger.error("error message")
```

## Query data with Kusto

To query Apache Spark events:

```kusto
SparkListenerEvent_CL
| where fabricWorkspaceId_g == "{FabricWorkspaceId}" and artifactId_g == "{ArtifactId}" and fabricLivyId_g == "{LivyId}"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| limit 100 
```

To query Spark application driver and executor logs:

```kusto
SparkLoggingEvent_CL
| where fabricWorkspaceId_g == "{FabricWorkspaceId}" and artifactId_g == "{ArtifactId}" and fabricLivyId_g == "{LivyId}"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| limit 100 
```

To query Apache Spark metrics:

```kusto
SparkMetrics_CL
| where fabricWorkspaceId_g == "{FabricWorkspaceId}" and artifactId_g == "{ArtifactId}" and fabricLivyId_g == "{LivyId}"
| where name_s endswith "jvm.total.used"
| summarize max(value_d) by bin(TimeGenerated, 30s), executorId_s
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

## Data limits
Fabric sends log data to Azure Monitor by using the HTTP Data Collector API. [The data posted to the Azure Monitor Data collection API is subject to certain constraints](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api#data-limits):

* Maximum of 30 MB per post to Azure Monitor Data Collector API. This is a size limit for a single post. If the data from a single post exceeds 30 MB, you should split the data into smaller sized chunks and send them concurrently.
* Maximum of 32 KB for field values. If the field value is greater than 32 KB, the data is truncated.
* Recommended maximum of 50 fields for a given type. This is a practical limit from a usability and search experience perspective.  
* Tables in Log Analytics workspaces support only up to 500 columns. 
* Maximum of 45 characters for column names.

## Create and manage alerts

Users can query to evaluate metrics and logs at a set frequency, and fire an alert based on the results. For more information, see [Create, view, and manage log alerts by using Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-metric-alert-rule).

## Fabric workspaces with managed virtual network
Azure Log Analytics can't currently be selected as a destination for Spark logs and metrics emission in a managed virtual network because the managed private endpoint doesn't support Log Analytics as a data source.
