# Create and manage Microsoft Fabric notebooks inside Visual Studio Code for the web

You can open a notebook in the VS Code for the Web experience by clicking the **Open in VS Code(Web)** button on the notebook authoring page in the Fabric portal.

## Run and debug notebooks in the VS Code web experience

You can run a notebook in the VS Code for the web experience by selecting the **Run** button in the notebook editor. Before you run the notebook, make sure to select the **Synapse VS Code -Remote** as the kernel. You can select it at the top right corner of the notebook editor.

Besides running the notebook, you can also debug the notebook in the VS Code web experience. Before you start the debug session, run the following code in the notebook to enable this feature.

```python
%%configure -f  
{  
    "conf": {  
        "livy.rsc.repl.session.debug-notebook.enabled": "true"  
    } 
} 
```

> [!NOTE]
> * It might take 2-5 minutes to finish the configuration. For each livy session, you only need to run this setup once.

After you run this configuration, you can set breakpoints in the notebook editor and run the notebook in debug mode. When the debug session starts, a notification is shown in bottom right corner of the editor to indicate that the debug session is initiated.

:::image type="content" source="media\vscode\debug-notebook-vs-code-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing debug session notification.":::

This debug session runs on the remote compute, requiring network traffic to sync debug information like breakpoint status. During the sync process, you can track the synchronization progress in the notebook editor's status bar.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please wait for the synchronization to finish before you continue the debug operation.
